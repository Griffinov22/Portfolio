# Portfolio

My portfolio made from scratch (HTML, CSS (boostrap is included), JS, emailJS, Google's reCaptcha v2)

Sites found helpful when developing:

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin)
- [Google's reCaptcha Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/site/664838653)

## Things I Learned

- How to handle Google's reCaptcha API with standard JavaScript
- Use an email provider for a contact form, so user's can contact me while still having the protection from a spam attack
- Hosting on Netlify and understanding the deployment of an attached Github repository
